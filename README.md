# no-more-focus-steal
This is a extension for the gnome that stops focus stealing behaviour. 

All operating systems have this focus stealing feature. And I hate that default behaviour. So I have stopped it. It also have a whitelist feature, so you can allow some fast apps to steal focus like console or settings panel etc. This extension is usefull for the slow and heavy apps like unity or other design apps.

# Known Bugs:
- When you click a switch on the settings menu, It does not clear the menu before add the new state. So it shows the double of everything but it is only visual bug. If you close and re open the settings, you can see the last state of the settings.
